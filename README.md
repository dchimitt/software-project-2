This repo contains a group project for the Software Engineering course at Purdue University Northwest. Its goal is to teach students how to use Docker / Docker Desktop.

The group will build a localhost webpage using Node.js and integrate a MySQL database containing a list of students, their names, their IDs, and their test scores.
The group will then containerize the completed project using Docker, allowing it to be run in any development environment.
